# ADAPay
ADAPay is a free and open-source Cardano (ADA) payment processor script written in PHP. 
You need to run a [cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) to work with ADAPay.  

With ADAPay you can simply create invoices for cardano payments in your webshop as well as verify the incoming payments.

## 1. Installation: cardano-wallet

‚≠ï **Very important!**  

It's very easy to run cardano-wallet on your server, but you need to take care that your server has the minimum 
hardware requirements to run your cardano-node:

- Min 2 vCPU 
- Min 8GB of RAM (12GB Recommended)
- 50 GB of disk space (Ideally SSD)
- Good internet connection (at least 10Mbps)

If your hardware did not meet the minimum requirements your cardano-node may not start/sync 
and you can not use the API the cardano-wallet will serve nor can use ADAPay.

### Installing cardano-wallet via docker-compose

So, your server is up and running you can simply download the latest docker-compose.yml and save it to your server. 
Use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to quickly spin up cardano-wallet together with supported block producer.
Here is exemplary docker-compose.yaml combining the latest versions of **cardano-wallet** and **cardano-node**.

We running on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

```bash
# Update operation system
apt-get update 
apt-get upgrade

# Install docker and docker-compose
apt-get install docker
apt-get install docker-compose

# Download latest docker-compose.yml 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/master/docker-compose.yml

# Start cardano-wallet in Background
NETWORK=mainnet docker-compose up -d
```

When your cardano-wallet is up running `NETWORK=mainnet docker-compose up -d` ou can simply check in your Browser the height of the Cardano Blockchain by requesting the following URL:  

```bash
http://<IP4-SERVER-ADDRESS>:8090/v2/network/information
```

It may take some time, maybe 1-2 days tilly our cardano-wallet is synced completely. When finish you get some "ready" status in the JSON response when browsing the above URL.

```json
{"network_tip":{"time":"2021-11-02T17:01:09Z","epoch_number":300,"absolute_slot_number":44306178,"slot_number":69378},"node_era":"alonzo","node_tip":{"height":{"quantity":6450485,"unit":"block"},"time":"2021-11-02T17:00:44Z","epoch_number":300,"absolute_slot_number":44306153,"slot_number":69353},"sync_progress":{"status":"ready"},"next_epoch":{"epoch_start_time":"2021-11-06T21:44:51Z","epoch_number":301}}
````

‚≠ï **Very important!**  

[cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) creates a public accessible [API](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/) on port 8090 (default). 
At easiest and best simple create firewall rules to access the cardano-wallet API only from specific IPs. 
You can create firewalls, mostly free, on popular hosting providers like Hetzner, Vultr or DigitalOcean. Of course you can setup a custom firewal rule 
in your operating system as well.

**Wanna run cardano-wallet API on https?** 

Simply setup a nginx proxy pass for the served API of the cardano-wallet

```bash
apt-get install nginx

# create some ssl certs
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 5478 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/cert.key -out /etc/nginx/cert.crt

# switch to nginx dir
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

# download nginx setup for adapay proxy
wget https://github.com/g33kme/adapay/main/nginx.adapay

# check nginx config and restart
service nginx configtest
systemctl restart nginx
```

You should now be able to browse your cardano-wallet API via https/ssl. Keep in mind that we don't created valid ssl certificates, so 
you get an insecure warning in your browser. However, we don't verify this on ADAPay.

```bash
https://<IP4-SERVER-ADDRESS>/v2/network/information
```

You may also take care to update your firewall settings and block public traffic for Port 443.


## 2. Installation: ADAPay

Alright, your cardano-wallet is up and running. Let's have a look to our ADAPay library to easily create invoices and check payments.

This library is installable via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require g33kme/adapay
```

## Requirements

This library requires PHP 7.1 or later.

## How to use ADApay

    'mnemonic' => 'that are just twenty four words that have not meaning and only for adapay as placeholder so dont try to copy this cheers adapay'
    'passphrase' => 'myAwesomeAdaPayPassword',

   'identify' => array(
        'type' => 'amount'
